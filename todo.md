# Todo List for Custom Camper Van Builder Directory Development

This todo list outlines the step-by-step tasks required to build the SaaS web directory for custom camper van builders in the USA, as specified in the Product Requirements Document (PRD).

## Phase 1: Planning and Design (Weeks 1-4)

1. **Finalize PRD Review**
   - Review the PRD with stakeholders.
   - Confirm requirements and resolve ambiguities.
   - Document sign-off from product owner.

2. **Define Technical Architecture**
   - Select frontend framework (React with JSX).

   - Finalize designs with stakeholder feedback.

4. **Set Up Project Infrastructure**
   - Initialize Git repository for version control.
   - Set up cloud hosting environment (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, or Vercel).
   - Configure CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
   - Set up development, staging, and production environments.

5. **Define Database Schema**
   - Create schema for builder data:
     - Builder Name (text, required)
     - Address (text, required)
     - City (text, required)
     - State (text, required, US state abbreviation)
     - Zip Code (text, 5-digit, required)
     - Phone Number (text, US format, optional)
     - Email (text, required)
     - Website (text, optional)
     - Social Media Links (array of URLs, optional)
     - Van Types (array of text, required)
     - Amenities (array of text, required)
     - Years of Experience (integer, optional)
     - Photos (array of up to 8 image URLs, required)
   - Enable geospatial indexing for zip code searches.
   - Document schema and validation rules.

## Phase 2: Development (Weeks 5-12)

6. **Set Up Backend**
   - Initialize Node.js/Express project.
   - Configure database connection (MongoDB or PostgreSQL).
   - Implement RESTful API endpoints:
     - GET /builders (search by state, zip code, or name).
     - GET /builders/:id (fetch individual builder details).
     - POST /builders (for future admin data entry, secured).
   - Integrate geocoding API for zip code to coordinates conversion.
   - Implement distance calculation for zip code searches (default 100-mile radius).
   - Set up cloud storage (AWS S3) for photo uploads.
   - Add input validation and error handling.
   - Implement rate limiting and HTTPS.

7. **Develop Frontend**
   - Set up React project with CDN-hosted dependencies (via cdn.jsdelivr.net).
   - Implement homepage with search bar (state dropdown, zip code input, builder name input).
   - Add autocomplete for builder name search.
   - Create list view with responsive card layout (Builder name, city, state, brief overview, van types, phone, social media icons, “View Details” button).
   - Add mileage badges for zip code searches, clickable to switch to map view.
   - Implement map view with clustering (Google Maps or Leaflet).
   - Create details page with “Overview” and “Gallery” tabs.
   - Add lightbox functionality for gallery photos.
   - Use Tailwind CSS for responsive styling.
   - Ensure mobile optimization (touch gestures, lazy-loaded images).

8. **Integrate Frontend and Backend**
   - Connect search inputs to API endpoints.
   - Fetch and display builder data in list and map views.
   - Implement dynamic view switching (list/map).
   - Handle “View Details” navigation and tabbed interface.
   - Ensure mileage badge clicks center map on the selected builder.

9. **Implement Accessibility**
   - Add ARIA labels for screen readers.
   - Ensure keyboard navigation for search, cards, and map controls.
   - Use high-contrast UI elements.
   - Test with accessibility tools (e.g., Lighthouse, WAVE).

10. **Optimize Performance**
    - Compress images for faster loading.
    - Implement lazy loading for gallery photos.
    - Ensure page load time < 2 seconds.
    - Optimize API queries for < 1-second response time.

## Phase 3: Data Collection (Weeks 13-16)

11. **Source Authentic Builder Data**
    - Contact camper van builders for data submission (manual outreach or form).
    - Verify data authenticity (e.g., cross-check with builder websites).
    - Collect required fields: name, address, city, state, zip code, email, van types, amenities, photos.
    - Collect optional fields: phone, website, social media links, years of experience.
    - Ensure all photos (up to 8 per builder) are authentic and high-quality.

12. **Populate Database**
    - Import verified data into the database.
    - Store photos in AWS S3 and save URLs in the database.
    - Validate data against schema (e.g., US phone format, valid URLs).
    - Perform geospatial indexing for addresses.

13. **Audit Data**
    - Conduct manual review of 100% of entries for accuracy.
    - Update or remove any invalid data.
    - Document data collection process for future scalability.

## Phase 4: Testing and Launch (Weeks 17-20)

14. **Unit and Integration Testing**
    - Test API endpoints for correct responses and error handling.
    - Verify geospatial queries for zip code searches.
    - Test frontend components (search, list view, map view, details page).
    - Validate mobile responsiveness across devices (iOS, Android, desktop).
    - Test accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 Level AA).

15. **User Acceptance Testing**
    - Conduct testing with a small group of users (e.g., van enthusiasts, stakeholders).
    - Gather feedback on usability, performance, and design.
    - Fix bugs and implement minor UI/UX improvements.

16. **Deploy to Production**
    - Deploy backend and frontend to cloud hosting.
    - Configure DNS and HTTPS.
    - Set up monitoring for uptime and performance (e.g., AWS CloudWatch).

17. **Post-Launch Monitoring**
    - Track success metrics (e.g., time on site, search usage, mobile performance).
    - Collect user feedback via a simple form on the site.
    - Address any critical bugs within 24 hours.

## Post-Launch (Ongoing)

18. **Maintenance and Updates**
    - Regularly audit builder data for accuracy.
    - Add new builders as submissions are received.
    - Monitor API and hosting costs.
    - Plan for future enhancements (e.g., reviews, advanced filters).

19. **Marketing and Outreach**
    - Promote the directory on social media and van life communities.
    - Partner with builders to increase visibility.
    - Analyze user engagement to refine marketing strategies.

## Notes
- All tasks must prioritize authentic data; no mock data is allowed.
- Development should focus on mobile optimization from the start.
- Regular stakeholder check-ins (weekly) to ensure alignment.
- Document all processes (e.g., data collection, testing) for future reference.
